# Attempt at Vesuvius Challenge

It is the year 79 in the Roman Empire when Mount Vesuvius erupts. The surrounding towns, like the
well known Pompeii, are covered in hot volcanic ash. One of the affected towns, Herculaneum, is home to a
giant library of ancient Roman and Greek texts that modern-day historians could only dream of reading.
Unfortunately, these papyrus scrolls are completely carbonized due to being covered in hot ash. Although
fortunately, their carbonization keeps them preserved for centuries to come. 

In 1750 these Herculaneum scrolls are discovered, and since then historians and scientists have been struggling to unwrap and read these
fragile carbonized scrolls, with little success. Previous techniques which involved physically trying to unwrap
the scrolls proved to have destructive effects, so with the advance of technology scientists turned to virtual
unwrapping. This involves taking high-resolution 3D x-ray scans of the scrolls, determining where there is
written ink, and reconstructing the unwrapped scroll. In 2019, the 3D scans of some of the scrolls were taken,
and now the problem lies in detecting ink. Our project attempts to do this using deep learning and computer
vision techniques, by creating a model that can learn the subtle features in the scans to determine where ink
is located and reconstruct the text, all with only three small scans of scroll fragments as the ground truth
labels.

This repository contains the code for our experiments and their description in the Report pdf.
